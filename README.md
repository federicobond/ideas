## Changelog aggregator

A service that sends you a weekly email with a summary of the changes in your favorite projects. Could also be served in RSS or website format, or even used as a webservice for others to build upon.

Contributors would submit changelog parsers for different projects and the service would take care of scrapping the latest changes.

 * There could also be some push service for instant updates.
 * We could also encourage the use of some standard changelog format.
